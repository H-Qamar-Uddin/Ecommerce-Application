# Fullstack project - 

## Installation

You should use either `npm` or `yarn` but not both. **It's recommended** to use `yarn`

This template already comes with all the needed packages.


There are two different folders:

1. `api:` where your backend lives

2. `client:` Frontend of your application

To install, you need to go to both directories and install their packages as such:

```bash
cd api
yarn install
```

```bash
cd client
yarn install
```

To run the `frontend` make sure you are under the client folder and:

````bash
yarn start
````

To run the `backend` make sure you are under the api folder and:

````bash
yarn start:dev
````
<br />

Note: 
1. I have generated this repo from private repository, thats the reason the commit is not visible.
2. Stil working on the project, some API endpoint is still missing.
